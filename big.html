            <p class = "p-3 pFont shadow">The combat was rather interesting as well, each party member chosen had four moves to pick from, and in different turns would be targetted to go out into the middle field in order to dodge attacks. In all new releases this battle system has been referred to as "clunky" or "just not the same".</p>

For instance, there were secret bosses found only by inserting the game cartridge in a certain way, referrences to other titles in hidden rooms, and other general random secrets found through absurd methods.</p>
