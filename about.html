            <p class = "pAbout p-3 shadow">Back on August 22nd of 1991, the Warriors arcade game was released. This was a Street Fighter-esc battle simulator starring characters like Kervin, Percy, Ghoulo, Larry, etc. The creator of the game even self-inserted himself as an unlockable character. The game was a partial success, but it paved the way for a long path of this company’s rich history. The arcade game was relatively successful and led to an indirect sequel known as “The Warriors GAME”. The game didn’t have a very creative name but it became an instant success. The Warriors Game is still to this day the best selling game that our company has made- selling about three million copies worldwide. The game has been ported onto newer consoles and even PC nowadays, but in its humble beginnings you had to play it on the NES exclusively. The success of this game was also the success of Kermito Studios. (recently rebranded to “Kermitoz Studioz” to appeal to a younger audience) A game like this needed to have a direct sequel, and that’s how we got The Warriors Game 2. This company of course couldn’t stop there, games like The Warriors 64, The Warriors Deluxe, and many more were created to try and mimic to success of our best seller. None of these titles have gone even close in numbers though, and seem to be declining. Kermitoz Studioz has some huge projects coming pretty soon though, so be ready for a load of fun! Also, if these don’t sell we’re gonna resort to making Minecraft mods, so yeah.</p>
